# Blindness

A 2D game to raise awareness about visual impairment. It's your first day of high school and you have to navigate to your first class. However, there's a problem, you can't see. Navigate through the school building by touching the walls around you until you find your classroom before class starts!

## Inspiration
A twist off of the virtual reality project "Notes on Blindness : Into Darkness".

## What it does
Shows people the difficulties for students with impaired vision to do simple things such as finding the way to class

## How we built it
Using Unity game engine and C# programming

## Challenges we ran into
* Collaborating on Unity game files on four different computers and also two different operating systems
* Using reverse-engineering of calculus to determine the brightness of a navigational feature in the game
* Blueprints of our level design wouldn't properly sync between all developers, causing some people to work on something that didn't exist for someone else

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Learning both Unity and C#
* Simplicity is better than complicated and ineffective

## What we learned
* Ways to collaborate and merge files over the Unity game engine interface
* Writing scripts for various functions such as menus, levels, and in-game choices

## What's next for Unseen
* Transitioning to doors that open only on a key touch, not on close proximity
* Adding more levels, even adding levels with multiple floors
* Move the game into 3D, most likely with Unreal Engine 4
  * This would easily allow for a smooth transition into VR
* Adding sound effects in sync with the character animations

## Built With
`Unity` `C#`
